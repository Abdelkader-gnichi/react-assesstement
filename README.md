   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

## Running in Development Mode

To run the project locally in development mode:
```bash
npm start
```

The development server will start, and the app will be available at http://localhost:3000.
The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

## Building the Project

To build the project for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the build folder.
The build is ready to be deployed to GitHub Pages or any other hosting service.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Ensure the homepage field in package.json is set to your GitHub Pages URL. For example:
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name"
   ```

2. Install the gh-pages package if not already installed:
   ```bash
   npm install gh-pages --save-dev
   ```

3. Add the following scripts to package.json if they don't already exist:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "sh deploy.sh"
   }
   ```

4. Deploy the project:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

This will deploy the build folder to the gh-pages branch of your repository.
Your site will be live at https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name.
